        <h2>Cats</h2>
        <p>
          Cats are independent and graceful creatures, known for their hunting
          abilities and aloof yet affectionate behavior. They enjoy both
          playtime and relaxation.

          Cats make excellent pets for people with busy lifestyles, as they
          require less attention than dogs. They are also very low maintenance.
