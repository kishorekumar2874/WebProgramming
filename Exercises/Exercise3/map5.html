    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <p>
      Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar
      system. It is a gas giant, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter
      has a Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has raged for centuries. It has
      at least 79 moons, including the large Galilean moons: Io, Europa,
      Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiter has faint rings made of dust particles.
