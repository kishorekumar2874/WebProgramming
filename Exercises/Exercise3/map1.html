    <h2>Mercury</h2>
    <p>
      Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and it's also the smallest in
      our solar system. It has a rocky surface with many craters, much like our
      Moon. Because it has almost no atmosphere, temperatures can swing from
      extremely hot to extremely cold. Mercury has no moons or rings. Its year
      is the shortest of all the planets, lasting only 88 Earth days.
