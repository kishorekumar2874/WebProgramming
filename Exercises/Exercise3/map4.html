    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <p>
      Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red
      Planet" due to its reddish appearance. It has the largest volcano and the
      deepest canyon in the solar system. Mars has a thin atmosphere, mostly
      carbon dioxide, and surface temperatures can be quite cold. There is
      strong evidence that liquid water once flowed on Mars. Mars has two small
      moons, Phobos and Deimos.
