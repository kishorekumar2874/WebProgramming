    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>
      Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size and
      structure to Earth. It has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat,
      making it the hottest planet. Venus rotates very slowly and in the
      opposite direction to most planets. Its surface is covered with volcanoes
      and deformed mountains. Venus has no moons or rings.
