    <h2>Pluto</h2>
    <p>
      Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the outer reaches of our solar system,
      beyond Neptune. It was once considered the ninth planet but was
      reclassified in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union. Pluto is
      small, with a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers, and it has a highly
      elliptical orbit. It is composed mainly of ice and rock and has five known
      moons, with Charon being the largest. Despite its distance from the Sun,
      Pluto's fascinating features, including its heart-shaped Sputnik Planitia
      and seasonal weather patterns, continue to intrigue astronomers.
