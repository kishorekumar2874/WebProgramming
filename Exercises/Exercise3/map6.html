    <h2>Neptune</h2>
    <p>
      Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar
      system. It is similar to Uranus, with a deep blue color due to methane in
      its atmosphere. Neptune has strong winds, the fastest in the solar system,
      and large storms. It has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with
      Triton being the largest. Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to complete
      one orbit around the Sun.
