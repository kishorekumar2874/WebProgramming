    <h2>Sun</h2>
    <p>
      The Sun is a massive star at the center of our solar system, composed
      primarily of hydrogen and helium. It is the primary source of energy for
      life on Earth, producing light and heat through nuclear fusion. The Sun's
      surface temperature is around 5,500°C (9,932°F), while its core reaches
      approximately 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit).
      It takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds for sunlight to travel from the
      Sun to Earth. The Sun has been shining for about 4.6 billion years and is
      expected to continue for another 5 billion years before becoming a red
      giant.
